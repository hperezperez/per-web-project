###Milestone 2 Feedback
Awesome job identifying your business and user's needs for this project. Dylan and I are excited to see this project take shape. Excellent work on the Milestone components, although take extra care to avoid errors in your code. See corrections below. You Milestone 2 passes at Tier II.

##Suggestions
- Take a look at Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools. I strongly suggest you add this to your project, as it will help you track web traffic to your site. Both are very easy to implement.
- Going forward you may want to look into Shopify or Magento to add e-commerce to your site. Shopify is fast and easy, while Magento requires a bit more development but offers more custom functionality. Unfortunaltely adding a shopping cart at this time most likely will fall out of scope.
- For your services and product pages, consider using good quality thumbnail images paired with descriptions.
- Familiarize yourself with Bootstrap forms, navbar, thumbnail images, and grid system.

##Corrections
I see you've made considerable improvements in your HTML code since Milestone 1. Good job on this. Things are looking much better, but there are still some major errors here.

1. Your HTML is missing the entire &lt;head&gt; tag. Refer to the [Bootstrap Basic Template]("https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/bootstrap-template.php") as a guide.
2. Beware of incomplete, empty, and missing closing tags in your HTML. See lines 4, 5, 59, 61, 78, 79.
3. All &lt;li&gt; tags must be enclosed inside a &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;. See the example code on [MDN]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul").
4. Please clean up all grammar and spelling mistakes going forward.
