###Milestone 2 Feedback
Awesome job identifying your business and user's needs for this project. Dylan and I are excited to see this project take shape. Excellent work on the Milestone components, although take extra care to avoid errors in your code. See corrections below. You Milestone 2 passes at Tier II.

##Suggestions
- Take a look at Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools. I strongly suggest you add this to your project, as it will help you track web traffic to your site. Both are very easy to implement.
- Going forward you may want to look into Shopify or Magento to add e-commerce to your site. Shopify is fast and easy, while Magento requires a bit more development but offers more custom functionality. Unfortunaltely adding a shopping cart at this time most likely will fall out of scope.
- For your services and product pages, consider using good quality thumbnail images paired with descriptions.
- Familiarize yourself with Bootstrap forms, navbar, thumbnail images, and grid system.

##Corrections
I see you've made considerable improvements in your HTML code since Milestone 1. Good job on this. Things are looking much better, but there are still some major errors here.

1. Your HTML is missing the entire &lt;head&gt; tag. Refer to the [Bootstrap Basic Template]("https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/bootstrap-template.php") as a guide.
2. Beware of incomplete, empty, and missing closing tags in your HTML. See lines 4, 5, 59, 61, 78, 79.
3. All &lt;li&gt; tags must be enclosed inside a &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;. See the example code on [MDN]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul").
4. Please clean up all grammar and spelling mistakes going forward.

###Milestone 3 Feedback
First thing, I am not seeing your current project code on GitHub. Have all recent changes been commited and pushed?

Good job on the wireframes. This layout should work well using Bootstrap, so become very familiar with the way the [Bootstrap Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic) works.
Simplify your content by 50% for the sake of MVP, since time is a major constraint. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier III.
 
##Suggestions
- Simplify features and layout by 50%
- Keep design of the layout clean and simple
- Place translate button at the top in the navbar
- Re-organize your directory structure to reflect the suggested architecture outlined in Milestone 1
- familiarize yourself with [PHP Gettext](http://php.net/manual/en/book.gettext.php)
- Commit and Push all changes to GitHub early and often. This is where Dylan and I evaluate all projects and code.

###Milestone 4 Feedback
- Great job so far. Let's bring in the header and footer onto the other pages using require_once();
- Let's hide the navbar search inside a dropdown, that will make things look cleaner
- Work on making the navigation mobile friendly. This can be done using the Bootstrap navbar.
- Clean up the typos in the content
- Consider editing images to be more consistent in size. Also, take a look at the flexbox code I put up on github that ensures the item thumbnails stay the same size.
- Swapping out the background image on the home page for a better one will make a big difference too.
